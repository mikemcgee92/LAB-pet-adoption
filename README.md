# Adoption Website

# Usage
* This web app allows the user to view a list of pets available for adoption.
* Each entry lists the pet's name, image (pulled from a link), color, a special skill, and one of three types of pets available - dog, cat or dinosaur (dino, for short).
* Users may use the buttons along the top to filter by type of pet.
* The last button brings up a form through which the user can input details for a new pet entry.
* Each pet entry has a delete button which will remove its card from the list.
